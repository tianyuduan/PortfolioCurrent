											<h3>Blurb about myself:</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>When you look at richest and the most successful people in the world. They are always learning. Bill Gates for one, loves to read. Learning builds perspective, learning stirs imagination, learning creates a better version of yourself as a person and also makes you a better communicator. Throughout my journey as a software engineer, I have come to accept and love learning. Whether its algorithims, programming languages, new frameworks, new technologies, working on improving yourself, the
												 accumulation of all these pieces that life taught me shaped me to become the engineer I am today.
										  </p>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												I think one of the greatest things about programming is learning from each other, bringing the manifestation of ideas into existence.
												Programmers break the barrier between conceptualization and a tangible, functional product.
												 We can take what we learned, put pieces together, overcome challenges we face and craft a product to directly impact our world today.

												I think that in itself is extremely gratifying. </p>

											<p class='text-indent'>
												Over the course of my journey, I have attained a level of mastery on topics like: JavaScript, React/React-Native, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Node.Js, Express, HTML5, CSS5, MongoDB, PhP, mySQL, AWS and Responsive Design.
											</p>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												I use React.Js almost everyday. I am passionate about creating responsive stylish and beautiful webpages.
											</p>

											<h3>The following passages below are my personal interests OUTSIDE of coding, proceed if interested!</h3>


											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="color: #C58BE7" class="icon fa-volume-up  "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'> Dancing</i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												Dancing is a progressional hobby. It is something I REALLY enjoy and love to do in my spare time. Don't even get me started on Kpop, I do a lot of Kpop covers with friends.
												Last year, I created a small kpop community by networking and bringing kpop enthusiasts together. Its really cool to go back to your older videos and see the progress you carved and worked hard for through the years.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="" class="icon fa-bicycle "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'> Fitness</i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												Fitness is also a progressional hobby. I gotten into working out consistently maybe in 2018 and have been working towards fitness goals I set for myself. I went from being not able to do any pull ups to doing weighted pulls up, muscle ups, etc.
												As well as going from ~ 18% body fat to maybe ~ 10%.
												Currently, I am working towards building core strength by doing calisthenics exercises.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="color: tan;" class="icon fa-user-plus "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'> Self Improvement </i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												I like to engross myself in books/Audible/podcasts when I am taking a break or driving somewhere. I think one of the key factors to success is knowledge, so being in the mindset, that you should NEVER EVER stop learning is one of key components that delineates our society's defintion of success.
												Personality plays a huge part in that as well, so I do read up on character building novels once in a while so I can practice being a more charismatic and present person.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="color: red;" class="icon fa-youtube-play "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'> Youtube </i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												I am fairly new in the field of making Youtube videos,
												but it is a great creative outlet for ideas that may come to me.
												I am always perfecting my crafting by making the quality of the videos better
												through research and practice.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="color: silver;" class="icon fa-cutlery "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'> Cooking </i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>
												Cooking is something I am fairly new in. As inexperienced as I am, it teaches valuable lessons in taking care of yourself. I try new recipes maybe around twice a week in hopes of getting better at cooking.
											</p>

											<h3>
												<span>
												  <i style="color: yellow;" class="icon fa-lightbulb-o "></i>
													<i class='margin-left'>  My Dream </i>
												</span>
											</h3>
											<p class='text-indent'>Aside from becoming an amazing programmer, my dream is one day becoming a stand-up comedian and using social media outlets like Youtube to inspire others. I want to bring laughter into their lives and use social media and the programming projects I have created to make the world a better place.</p>
